# Employee Salary Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict employee salaries based on various features like job title, experience, education level, and other job-related attributes using machine learning algorithms. Accurate salary prediction helps in data-driven HR decisions, fair compensation, and hiring strategy optimization.

## 📌 Problem Statement

The salary structure across different roles can vary due to experience, skills, and other parameters. Manually estimating fair salaries is challenging and subjective. This project uses a dataset of employee details and builds a machine learning model that can:

- Automate salary prediction
- Remove estimation bias
- Help HR departments benchmark compensation fairly

## 🧠 System Development Approach

### 📦 System Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook

### 📚 Libraries Used
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
- `xgboost`

### 🛠 Workflow
1. Data preprocessing and cleaning
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature engineering and encoding
4. Model training using multiple algorithms
5. Evaluation using R², MAE, MSE
6. Deployment of the best-performing model

## ⚙️ Algorithm & Deployment

The following machine learning models were implemented:

- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor
- XGBoost Regressor

### Steps Followed:
1. Loaded and cleaned the dataset
2. Handled null and duplicate values
3. Visualized data using EDA techniques
4. Encoded categorical variables
5. Split data into training and testing sets
6. Trained the models and evaluated performance
7. Selected the best model (XGBoost)
8. Predicted salaries on test data
